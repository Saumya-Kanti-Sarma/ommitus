# Ommitus – SiteMap

Ommitus is structured into five main portals, each with its own route prefix:

* **Landing Portal** → `/`
* **Auth Portal** → `/auth`
* **Restaurant Portal** → `/restaurant`
* **Customer Portal** → `/customer`
* **Admin Portal** → `/admin` *(To be integrated after onboarding 5+ restaurants)*
